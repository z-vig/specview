# `cubeview` 🔎

A Flexible and Interactive Spectral (and more!) Image Viewer for Python

---

## Motivation ✨

Whether it's an imaging spectrometer or an InSAR time-series, many remotely
sensed scientific data comes in the form of a cube, which is here defined as
any dataset that has spatial information in two dimensions and measured values
in a third dimension. Below are listed some examples of scientific data cubes:

- Hyperspectral Imagery
- Multispectral Imagery
- InSAR Time Series
- Cloud Cover Evolution Map
- Spectral Maps from lab spectrometers
- And Many More!


## Installation ⬇️

`cubeview` can be directly install from the Python Package Index using `pip`.

```bash
pip install cubeview
```

## Usage ⚙️

The basic `cubeview` GUI can be opened directly from the command line by ensuring you are in a python environment that has `cubeview` installed and running

```bash
cubeview.exe
```

The `cubeview` GUI can also be started from a python script.

```python
from cubeview import open_cubeview
open_cubeview(image_data, cube_data, wvl_data)
```
Where the data can optionally provided as either a Numpy-Array or a filepath to one of the supported file types.
